    <h2>Why I'm Learning Web Development?</h2><p>
      I am learning web development firstly because of the potential better compensation compared to my current job, which is an admin for a healthcare company.<p>
        However what sparked my interest with learning to code is the <em>Work OS <strong>Monday.com</strong></em> that we use inhouse. As one of the company's admin I am incharge of setting up <em>automation</em> for our work boards.<p>
          Learning, Setting up and Deploying this to my team feels Great!and I love to dive further in to what makes <em>monday.com</em> tick.<p> There are a few things I want to fixed/improve on it as well.
            If was asked what my end goal right now is. It would be to make something comparable or better than <em>monday.com</em>.<p>
              Another major thing that inspired me to study web development is our inhouse dev team in my current company <a href="https://theoriamedical.charteasy.com/"><em><strong>Theoria Medical</strong></em></a>
